<h1>DccwBypassUAC</h1>

This exploit abuses the functionality of "dccw.exe" so as to obtain an administrator shell (bypass UAC). It supports "x86" and "x64" architectures. It has been successfully tested on Windows 10 14393, Windows 10 15031 and Windows 10 15062.

In the following days more updates will be uploaded, even a Metasploit version.

To develop the exploit, I have based on those created by:<br>
